SLAPDCONF INSTALLATION
----------------------

slapdconf is a set of Perl scripts. Unfortunatelly currently there are no
packages for any Linux distribution (help with packaging is highly
appreciated). Therefore simply copy the scripts to /usr/local/bin or
/usr/local/sbin. You will also need Perl libraries that these scrips 
depend on:

Net::LDAP
Authen::SASL
UUID
and perldoc

In debian/ubuntu you can install those libraries by running:

sudo apt-get install libnet-ldap-perl libauthen-sasl-perl libuuid-perl perl-doc
